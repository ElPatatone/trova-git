# Why?

I think we've all been there, we get excited about something and create a new project, maybe we spend days or weeks on it and then poof we just completely forget about it.  
This is my attempt to not create a graveyard for forgotten projects,
Everytime you open the terminal this tool will show you a list of all the git repositories in the local machine and several information for each one.

I plan to filter the repos in several groups such as:

- repos with unstaged files
- repos with commits waiting to be pushed
- repos with staged files waiting for comments
- repos with commits older than a certain time frame
